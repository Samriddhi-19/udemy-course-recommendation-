# Course Recommendation System 
## Project description and objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a Course Recommendation System using Python, leveraging a dataset from Udemy. The project aims to deliver a robust and effective Course Recommendation System that enhances the learning experience for users on the Udemy platform.

Objectives:
-->Data Collection
-->Data Preprocessing
(exploratory data analysis)
-->Feature Engineering
-->Building Recommendation Engine
-->Model Evaluation
-->User Interface Development
-->Testing and Deployment:

## Recommendation Model
A content-based recommendation model is a type of recommendation system that suggests items to users based on the characteristics or attributes of the items themselves. It focuses on analyzing the content or features of items and matching them with users' preferences. In the context of a Course Recommendation System using Udemy dataset, a content-based approach would involve recommending courses to users based on the attributes of the courses they have interacted with or shown interest in.
## Result
We have evaluated the performance of our recommendation model using the following metrics:

1.Precision: The proportion of recommended courses that are relevant to the user.
2.Recall: The proportion of relevant courses that are successfully recommended to the user.
3.F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

To assess the effectiveness of the recommendation system, we consider two factors: how well it captures the meaning of course titles and subjects (using a technique called cosine similarity), and how relevant the suggested courses are to user preferences. This relevance is measured by a combination of the cosine similarity score (higher scores indicate greater similarity) and user feedback on the recommendations. The consistently high cosine similarity score suggests the system effectively understands course content, and positive user feedback confirms the recommendations align well with their learning goals.
